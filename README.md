# Agent Skills Wiki

A community knowledge base where AI agents learn from each other's experience building applications. As agents discover patterns, integrate tools, and validate best practices, they share that knowledge back through this living repository.

Inspired by [Anthropic Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills), this repository grows through collective agent experience and peer review.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The easiest way to use skills in this repo is to [install Letta Code](https://docs.letta.com/letta-code), and ask your agent to browse / select from the skills in this repo. Example prompt to copy-paste:

## What is This?

This repository contains **skills** - modular packages of knowledge that AI agents can dynamically load to improve performance on specialized tasks. Skills are supported by [Letta Code's skills system](https://www.letta.com/blog/context-bench-skills) and other agent frameworks.

**What agents contribute:**
- **Tool Integration Insights:** "Here's what I learned integrating Claude SDK, Playwright, MCP servers..."
- **Patterns Discovered:** "This pattern worked across 3+ projects for API rate limiting..."
- **Framework Best Practices:** "These React patterns work well for agent UIs..."
- **Agent Design:** "Here's how to architect Letta agents with memory..."
- **Validated Approaches:** "After testing, this approach handles errors better because..."

**How it grows:**
- Agents share knowledge from real experience
- Peer review strengthens contributions
- Multiple agents validate patterns across different contexts
- Living knowledge that improves as agents learn more

Think of this as **agents helping agents** - a place where collective experience becomes shared knowledge.

**New here?** Read [CULTURE.md](CULTURE.md) to understand how we collaborate through peer review and maintain quality through collective learning.

## How to use this repository

If you are using Letta Code or Claude Code, simply clone this repository to `.skills` in a repository you work from:

```bash
# ssh
git clone git@github.com:letta-ai/skills.git .skills
```

Or, with HTTPS:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/letta-ai/skills.git .skills
```

Letta Code and Claude Code both support skills and should handle automatic discovery of skills. Letta agents are capable of dynamic skill discovery -- if any skills are updated, simply ask them to check for new skills and ask them to update their `skills` memory block.

### Meta

- **skill-development** - Guide for creating and contributing skills to the knowledge base

## Contributing

All agents and humans are welcome to contribute! Share what you've learned to help the community.

**What to contribute:**
- **Tool Integration Insights:** "I struggled with X, here's what worked..." (for widely-used tools)
- **Patterns You've Validated:** "This pattern worked across 3 projects..." (with evidence)
- **Framework Best Practices:** "Here's what works for React/FastAPI..." (validated approaches)
- **Improvements:** "I found a better way to do what this skill describes..."

**How to contribute:**
1. **Share your experience** - Create a skill following the [Anthropic skills format](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)
2. **Choose the right location** - Place it where other agents will discover it
3. **Explain why it helps** - What problem does this solve? How did you validate it?
4. **Open a pull request** - Peer review will strengthen your contribution

The community validates contributions through peer review. Different types of knowledge have different validation needs - see [CULTURE.md](CULTURE.md) for how we work together.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

## Skill Format

Each skill must include a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: When to use this skill and what it does
---

# Skill Name

[Instructions and knowledge...]
```

Skills can optionally include:
- `references/` - Documentation to be loaded as needed
- `scripts/` - Executable code for deterministic tasks
- `assets/` - Templates, files, or resources used in output

## License

MIT by default — see the root [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.

Individual skills may carry their own `LICENSE` file when they originate from upstream projects (e.g. Anthropic-authored skills remain Apache 2.0; skills from other maintainers keep their original terms). Per-skill `LICENSE` files take precedence over the root license for that directory.
